Predict the next re-admission to the hospital for diabetes.

# Warmup Questions

#### 1. What is the probability distribution for readmission?

#### 2. Is there any difference in chances to be re-admitted for different age groups? How about gender? How about the weight?
  (Hint: you can use visualizations and/or statistical tests to check this)

#### 3. Some patients do go under special medical treatments. Can you use the available dataset to identify which medical specialities are more correlated to re-admission? Can you comment on your findings?

#### 4. It is advised to regularly run medical checkups. Using the dataset, can you identify variables that can indicate the frequency of Dr visits? Unfortunately, among those visits, we can't easily distinguish routine visits from serious illness visits. Simply, we can investigate the correlation between the number of visits and re-admission. So, what can you say about:
  - readmission and number of visits
  - patient's age, weight, gender and number of visits. For example, it's interesting to see who visit Dr's more often between young and old people, male and females, and how can the weight play a role

### 5. Investigate the relationship between the readmission and the number of previous diagnosis

### 6. Build a model to predict the readmission based on the given dataset. What are the most significants variables to predict a patient's readmission?
